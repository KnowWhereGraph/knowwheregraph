# Ontology

*KnowWhereGraph has a large ontology*. It's no secret that navigating *any* ontology is a time consuming, difficult process. KnowWhereGraph is no exception.

We provide a [Widoco](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco) documentation page for our ontology, which includes diagrams to help compartmentalize, visualize, and easily digest the various components.

## Key Points

There are several key points that make working with and understanding the ontology easier.

### Understanding Time

KnowWhereGraph uses [OWL time](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/) for temporal information.

### Understanding Space

Spatial information is encoded using the [GeoSPARQL](https://www.ogc.org/standard/geosparql/) standard.

### Understanding Data Values

Data is encoded using the [SOSA](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/) ontology.
